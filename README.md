# mzScope
MS data visualization and exploration tool based on the mzDBfile format

mzScope is a visualization and exploration tool written in Java allowing users to visualize scans and chromatograms extracted from mzDB file. Since mzDB format support DIA MS data, mzScope also provides MS2 chromatogram extraction within a selected isolation window that can be performed on user supplied m/z values or from ion fragment masses imported from a spectral library. Those features combined with the efficiency of the mzDB format make mzScope a suitable tool for MS data visualization and exploration or for raw MS signal comparison.
